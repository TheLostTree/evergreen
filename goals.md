# Goals

- No staticly compiled protos; all runtime loaded lazily (async?)
- CmdIds are also loaded at runtime, from a txt file that can be changed at runtime as well
- Proto files can be changed at runtime, and reloaded
- Show data, as well as field info for unknown fields (to help figure out protos)
- essentially be cyberchef 
- load from pcap (for now) to speed up testing

- will make separate project for known protos
